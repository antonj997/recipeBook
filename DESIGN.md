# Recipebook design guide

Use the owner's Anthropic references: off-white surfaces, near-black text, thin rules, generous space and simple food line drawings. Keep labels short and factual. Body and controls use Arial/Helvetica; recipe titles use Georgia. No external font or animation package is needed.

## Layout and controls

The header and pages share a centered 1360px maximum width and `--page-gutter`. Forms use an 800px maximum. Mobile pages start with 20px top padding. Search and Add recipe share a row; focusing search condenses Add to its icon. Search fields share the green underline. Empty libraries show centered Create recipe, Import recipe and Import cookbook actions instead of the toolbar.

Primary controls are dark, secondary controls outlined, destructive controls use `--color-danger`. Keyboard focus hugs each element with a 2px outline; touch input suppresses the ring without affecting keyboard navigation. Use the shared SVG checkbox everywhere. Recipe step boxes show their number until checked; completion draws a restrained line over the text and collapses it to one line.

## Recipe cards and carousel

Cards have a flush 4:3 photo over a padded color block within a 16px radius. Photo cards rotate blue, clay, sage, lavender, beige and washed yellow. Missing-photo cards share the exact stable background choice with their food drawing. Card metadata shows total time when available. Titles never gain an underline on hover.

Desktop cards are 240–340px wide with 28px gaps. Mobile cards are 78vw with 18px gaps and centered snapping. Preserve native horizontal scrolling, mandatory snap and `scroll-snap-stop: always`. Edge masks soften clipped neighbors; blur/displacement are optional enhancements that never intercept input. Arrow and keyboard navigation move by card. Compact centered dots expand smoothly with carousel position, hover and focus. Duplicate clamped desktop end positions share one dot.

## Motion

The wordmark is upright medium-weight sans-serif and stays still on hover. The settings icon tilts slightly, with no hover fill. Card surfaces tilt smoothly toward the mouse, up to six degrees vertically and eight horizontally; scroll velocity adds a small temporary tilt that settles to zero. Carousel arrows stay still on hover. Section controls gently change fill and checkbox hover remains slight. Search hover fill is desktop-only; mobile retains the green focus underline. Restrict hover effects to devices that support hover, with pointer tilt limited to a fine pointer.

Import feedback shows a stirring pot, independently rising steam and a recipe-sheet check. Successful imports stay visible for at least three seconds, then finish the check before review opens. On mobile the illustration fills the viewport with one randomly chosen muted palette color. No falling ingredients. The existing paper-and-bin delete animation stays intact.

Reduced motion removes transitions, continuous loops and tilt, and makes carousel scrolling immediate. Feedback and completed states remain visible.

## Recipe review and overlays

Unsaved recipes reuse the saved recipe view. A compact floating action bar provides looks good!, cancel and edit. Approval alone saves to Dexie. Hide settings during review and editing. A shared native dialog protects discard and navigation; native browser warnings protect refresh and tab closing. Only floating controls, menus, dialogs and feedback use restrained shadows.

## Maintainability

Reuse semantic global colors and existing shared icons/components. Keep recipes, images, collections and offline storage intact. Avoid slogans, dense raised panels and decorative copy. Navigation must work independently of animation and glass effects.
